The Physical Layer
-------------------
* Main focus is moving ones and zeros from one end of the link to the next;
- It consists of devices and means of transmitting bits across the computer networks;
* Bit - The smallest representation of data that a computer can understand; it's a one or zero;
- Ones and Zeros are sent across the network through a process called modulation;
* Modulation - It is a way of varying the voltage of the charges moving across the cable;
* Line coding - Modulations used for computer networks -  enable devices and both ends of the network to realize the state of data as a 0 or a 1;

Twisted Pair Cabling and Duplexing
-----------------------------------
- Twisted Pairs -> Copper wires twised that behave as a conduit of information preventing electromagnetic interference and crosstalk from neighbouring pairs;
- Standard CAT6 cable -> 8 wires, 4 twisted pairs inside a single jacket, based on the transmission technology used the respective no of pairs are used;

Network Ports and Patch Panels
-------------------------------
* The ends of the twisted pair are attached to plugs. A common plug is the RJ45 port (Registered Jack 45).
- A network cable with RJ-45 plug can connect to an RJ-45 network port.
* Network ports are generally directly attached to the devices that make up a computer network;
- Switched will have many network ports because their purpose is to connect to many devices;
- Servers and desktops usually have only one or two network ports;
- Laptops, Servers, tablets or phones probably do not have any network ports; (Wireless networking);
