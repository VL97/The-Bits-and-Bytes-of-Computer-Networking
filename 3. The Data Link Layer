* Ethernet
------------------------------
-> Ethernet - The DATA LINK LAYER protocol most widely used to send data scross individual networks;
-> Ethernet solved the problem with collison domain by - 
            Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detecttion - CSMA/CD  
            Now Obsolete as we have full-duplex cables now.
-> CSMA/CD - Used to determine when the coomunication is clear and when a device is free to transmit data;
    - If there is no data being transmitted on the network segment, a node will feel free to send the data;
    - If two or more computers end up trying to send data at the same time the computers detect the collision and stop sending the data;
    - Each device involved with the collision then waits a random interval of time before trying to send data again;
    - This random interval prevents the data from computers from colliding again;

* WIFI
------------------------------
-> Uses CSMA/CA - Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance - CSMA/CA
    - Works similar to CSMA/CD.
    - Collisions are inferred from Non-receival of ACKs.
    - May use RTS/CTS master-slave configuration.

* MAC address (Media Access Controll Address)
--------------------------------------------------
-> A globaly unique identifier attached to an individual network interface;
     - It is a 48-bit number normally represented by six grouping of two hexadecimal numbers;
-> A MAC address is split into two:
     - OUI ( Organizationally Unique Identifier) - First three octets of a MAC address, these are assigned to individual hardware manufacturers by IEEE;
     - the last three octets of MAC address can be assigned in any way the manufacturer would want but it must be unique;
-> Ethernet uses MAC addresses to ensure that data send has an MAC address of the:
     the sender machine, and 
     the receiver machine.
    
* Unicast, Multicast, and Broadcast
-----------------------------------
  -> Unicast - unicast transmission is meant for one receiving address;
      - Identification - If the least significant bit in the first octet of a destination address is set to zero, it means that ethernet frame is intended for only the destination address.
  -> Multicast - 
          Identification - If the least significant bit in the first octet of a destination address is set to one, it means that ethernet frame is a multicast frame.
                           The packet(ethernet frame here) can be selectively discarded/accepted by all the machines based on predefined criterions.
  -> Broadcast - intended for all receivers on the LAN. It uses a broadcast address and constitues of all F's. FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF;
  
* Dissecting an Ethernet Frame
-------------------------------
  -> Data packet - An all-encompassing term that represents any single set of binary data being sent across a network link;
  -> Data packets at the Ethernet level are known as Ethernet frames;
  -> Ethernet Frame - A highly structured collection of information presented in a specific order;
  
* Ethernet Frame
-----------------
   Preamble - 8 bytes
   Destination MAC Address - 6 bytes
   Source MAC Address - 6 bytes
   Tag - 4 bytes
   Ether-type - 2 bytes
   Payload - 0 - 1500 bytes
   FCS - 4 bytes
   
   -. Destination MAC Adress - The hardware address of the intended recipient; (48 bits / 6 bytes)
   -. Source MAC Address - The hardware address of the source;
   -. Payload - It is the actual data being transported excluding the header; - contains data from higher network layers - IP, transport;
   -. FCS - Frame Check Sequence - 4 bytes - checksum value for the entire frame - it is calculated by performing what is known as a cyclical redundancy check against the frame;
  
  * Cyclical Redundancy Check (CRC) - An important concept for data integrity and is used all over computing, not just network transmissions - uses polynomial division to create a number that represents a larger set of data -  to ensure the data is not corrupted;

-> Ethernet reports of data integrity; The FCS on the sender is matched with the receiver in case of a mismatch it is thrown out and is upto a higher level protocol to decide if the frame needs to be re-transmitted;
